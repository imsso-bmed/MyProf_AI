For example, investorsâ€™ decisions constrain whether the following projects essential to decarbonization get financed, as well as what scale and pace: technologies for cheaper and more reliable alternative energy production; rebuilding of energy infrastructure; installation of new electrical grids; low-carbon ground, air, and marine transportation; overhauling buildings and heating systems; installation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on power, steel, cement, and other industrial production process; and so on.
