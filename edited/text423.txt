According to an influential view articulated by Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz, it is a “delusion” to “see the firm characterized by the power to settle issues by fiat, by authority, or by disciplinary action superior to that available in the conventional market.” Alchian and Demsetz even suggest that managerial supervision is merely a metaphor: “[t]o speak of managing, directing or assigning workers to various tasks is a deceptive way of noting that the employer continually is involved in renegotiation of the contracts on terms that must be acceptable to both parties.” Alchian and Demsetz are commonly interpreted as proposing an “authority-free, purely contractual” theory of the firm, entirely distinct from the Coasian ‘authority-based’ theory.
