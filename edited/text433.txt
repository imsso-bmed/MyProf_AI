The Master sanctions members who fail to complete their task by his right to “demote [them], reduce their [assigned lot], assign them inconvenient hours or too many or too few hours, assign them more dangerous, dirty, menial, or grueling tasks” such as counting blades on muddy land, “increase their pace” of counting, “set them up to fail,” or, at worst, expulsion from the organization.
